Database functions :
-User can create/modify/delete container to hold images on the database
-Only save image/file URL when the user uploads an image

Functionality :
-Use Cloudinary API for ease-of-use image/file uploading
-ONLY authenicated users can upload files
-Session based auth using passport(look at members-only project)
-Use Prisma session library to persist session in the database

Maybe:
Use multer middleware to hold files in ecosystem till all other features are working
